When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When we want to share our code with other people and collaborate our work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It should depend on us when we think its appropriate to push to remote repository or pull on our local repository.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches happen on one single repository.
	Cloning is copying of repositories from one system to another. Creates clone of the  repository.
	Forking is just like cloning. Where Github gives us the advantage of cloning others repositories' onto their machine. (onto here refers to Github)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can modify from that state even when we dont have internet access and make the changes and commit from there whenever we get working internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	We would regularly send our code to thetteammates. Without github we would have to do most of the work manually.
