When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When we want to share our code with other people and collaborate our work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It should depend on us when we think its appropriate to push to remote repository or pull on our local repository.
