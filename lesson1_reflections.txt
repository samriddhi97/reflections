How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  
     It would point out that where the differences were and we can correct those changes.	It saves history of a  file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long run?

	We can easily view the history of all the versions of our file and get to know as to what changes did what to our file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Even if we forget to commit our file and loose our data due to our unforgetfulness. Git does the task for us by automatically saving the versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	so that we can easily see the changes being made.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log can be used to see the list of commits made in the file and git diff can be used to see the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	As, we can easily checkout from the version that caused the accidental bug. Therefore, we can confidently make changes even if it breaks something.
